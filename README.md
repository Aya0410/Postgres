# Database Administration Project: PostgreSQL and MSSQL Implementation

Welcome to my Database Administration project! This repository showcases my skills in managing PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases through a series of hands-on tasks, including replication, indexing, and data migration.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a functional PostgreSQL and MSSQL database environment using Docker, with an emphasis on practical administration tasks:

- **Database Setup and Configuration**: Initiated PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases using Docker, following best practices for setup and container management.
- **Streaming Replication**: Configured a PostgreSQL streaming replication setup between two database containers, demonstrating my ability to ensure data redundancy and availability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enabled long query logging to monitor and optimize performance, and created indexes on tables for faster query execution.
- **Data Migration**: Implemented data migration from PostgreSQL to MSSQL, handling the conversion between different SQL dialects and ensuring data consistency.

## Key Features

1. **PostgreSQL Streaming Replication**  
   Set up streaming replication to enable real-time data backup and improve data reliability.
   
2. **Index Creation**  
   Designed and created indexes to optimize data retrieval speeds, with a clear explanation of index selection and its impact on performance.

3. **Cross-Platform Data Migration**  
   Migrated data from PostgreSQL to MSSQL, addressing compatibility and integrity issues to ensure a smooth transition. 

4. **Performance Monitoring**  
   Activated long query logging, gaining insights into database performance and identifying areas for optimization.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **PostgreSQL and MSSQL Administration**
- **Dockerized Database Management**
